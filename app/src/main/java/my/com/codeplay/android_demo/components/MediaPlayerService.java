     * as the client component (in other words it runs within the same process and is not
     * available to components in other applications), the recommended mechanism is to create
     * a subclass of the Binder class and extend it to provide an interface to the service.
     * An instance of this Binder object is then returned by the onBind() method and subsequently
     * used by the client component to directly access methods and data held within the service.
     *
     * 2. In situations where the bound service is not local to the application
     * (in other words, it is running in a different process from the client component),
     * interaction is best achieved using a Messenger/Handler implementation.
